CEG Hypermarket Inventory Control and Monitoring System (CICMS) enables users (e.g., a store manager) to add new products to be carried in the store, scrap products which the supermarkets has decided to stop selling, specify the sale of products and allow restocking of products. It also enables the users to identify the top manufactures and save the product lists to text files.

CICMS is developed in VS2012, .NET 4.5
